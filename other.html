    <p>Here are some cool places I've visited so far:</p>
    <div id="abbeyroad">
      <p><strong>Abbey Road</strong></p>
      <img src="abbeyroad.jpeg" >
      <p>I walked across the street-crossing shown in this photo and stood outside the studio where the Beatles recorded their Abbey Road album. Pink Floyd also recorded some albums at this studio, which is what interested me the most.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="animals">
      <p><strong>Battlesea Power Station</strong></p>
      <img src="animals.jpeg" >
      <p>To continue my trend of visiting places featured on album covers, I went to Battlesea Power Station. This is what is shown on the front cover of Pink Floyd's album Animals. Now it is a mall, but I had fun walking around and checking out all the shops.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="coventgarden">
      <p><strong>Covent Garden</strong></p>
      <img src="coventgarden.jpeg" width="300">
      <p>I visited Covent Garden and perused the market. I also watched a street performer play guitar for a very large crowd of people. He played Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, and we all loved singing along.</p>
